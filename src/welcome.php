  <h4>What To Bring</h4>

<ul><li><p>
Lots of attendees bring their laptops and tablets for taking notes and posting tweets during our sessions (#PCTO17). We're working with our venue hosts to get Wi-Fi set up for PodCamp attendees. That said, PodCamp is a rare opportunity for us to talk face to face, so let's do that too!
</p></li>
<li><p>
Need juice? We don't have a charging station available but there are plugs all around the venue, so do bring your chargers!
</p></li>
<li><p>
Old school? Pens, pencils, and notebooks are all welcome here. No judgement!
</p></li>
<li><p>
Other good accoutrements include water bottles, snacks, and some spending money. While you could bring a lunch and enjoy it on site (nothing wrong with that!), many of our attendees get together for informal lunch plans and venture out to the Ryerson environs.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Need more guidance?
Information about our venues, local accommodations and travel/parking options are available on our <a href="http://2017.podcamptoronto.com/logistics/">Logistics page</a>.

  <h4>Rules</h4>


<ul>
  <li><p><strong>PodCamp should be your experience.</strong> You get out of it what you put in. This event is to you what you make it! Be sure to branch out and explore instead of sticking with friends just cause it's comfortable. Find your own direction.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>PodCamp is an unconference.</strong> The agenda is fluid. If you have a session idea last minute, we have breakout rooms for impromptu sessions.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Since PCTO is an unconference, the standard conference rules do not apply.</strong> If you find yourself sitting in a session with a title and description that really spoke to you, but the actual content isn&rsquo;t what you had hoped for, walk yourself out of the room and find one you will enjoy. Quietly, and respectfully, of course!</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Sessions are 45 minutes long with a 15 minute break between each.</strong> Please pack up quickly at the end of each session to give the next presenter time to set up.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Please respect the PodCamp space.</strong> Ryerson University has been our home since the first PodCamp Toronto in 2007, and we would like to continue this tradition. Put your trash in the proper trash bins.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Use the &#35;PCTO17 hashtag.</strong> Be a friend and tell the PodCamp story for those who can&rsquo;t attend by including the #PCTO17 hashtag in all of your tweets, pics, check-ins, blogs, etc!</p></li>
